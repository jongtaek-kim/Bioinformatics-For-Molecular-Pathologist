## 1. Wha Is Bioinformatics?
### Bioinformatics is an intersection between biological data (like DNA sequence) and computer programming (software).

## 2 Setting Up Your Computer For NGS Tutorial
### Install Miniconda which contains the conda package manager.
### Once Miniconda is installed, you can use the conda command to install any other packages such as FastQC, Trimmomatic, BWA, SAMtools, GATK, etc.

### *Click here for complete instructions [(Setting Up)](https://github.com/jongtaek-kim/Bioinformatics-For-Molecular-Pathologist/tree/main/Setting-Up-Your-Computer)

## 3. Introduction To The Command Line.
### Learn basic UNIX command-line coding (Needed later to perform quality control, align reads to a reference genome, and annotate variants).
### *Click here for complete instructions [(Command Line Tutorials)](Command-Line-Coding/README.md)

## 4. FastQC
### [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) is a quality control tool for high throughput sequence data such as next generation sequencing.

### [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic) is flexible read trimming tool you can use to remove bad quality reads and perform adaptor clipping.
