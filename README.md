## 1. Wha Is Bioinformatics?
### Bioinformatics is an intersection between computer programming (software) and biological data (like DNA sequence).

## 2 Setting Up Your Computer For NGS Tutorial
### Install Miniconda which contains the conda package manager.
### Once Miniconda is installed, you can use the conda command to install any other packages such as FastQC, Trimmomatic, BWA, SAMtools, GATK, etc.

## 4. FASTQC
## 5. Alignment (SAM/BAM)
## 6. Variant Calling
## 7. Tertiary Analysis (Interpretation/Report)
